The last version of English Certificate in my university (OldCertificate.jpg) was quite old-fashioned and badly made.
You can look at the quality of images on the main page.(OldCertificate2.jpg)
I made a new one in Adobe Illustrator by using vector graphics.
Now it can be scaled as much as I want to and it looks much better and contemprorary.
